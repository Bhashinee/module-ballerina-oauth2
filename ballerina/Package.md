## Package Overview

The `oauth2` library is one of the standard library modules of the <a target="_blank" href="https://ballerina.io/">Ballerina</a> language.

This module provides a framework for interacting with OAuth2 authorization servers as specified in the <a target="_blank" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749">RFC 6749</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7662">RFC 7662</a>.

The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service either on behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource owner and the HTTP service or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf.

The Ballerina `oauth2` module facilitates auth providers that are to be used by the clients and listeners of different protocol connectors.
