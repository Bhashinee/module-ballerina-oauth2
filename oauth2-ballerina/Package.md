## Package Overview

The `oauth2` library is one of the standard library modules of the [Ballerina](https://ballerina.io/) language.

This module provides a framework for interacting with OAuth2 authorization servers as specified in the [RFC 6749](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749) and [RFC 7662](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7662).

The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service either on behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource owner and the HTTP service or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf.

The Ballerina `oauth2` module facilitates auth providers that are to be used by the clients and listeners of different protocol connectors.
